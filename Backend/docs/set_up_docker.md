2. Run the following command to enter the container's shell:

   ```
   docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> bash
   ```

   Replace `<container_id_or_name>` with the actual container ID or name you noted earlier.

3. Once inside the container's shell, run the following command to create a superuser:

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter the username, email, and password for the superuser.

4. After creating the superuser, exit the container's shell by typing:

   ```
   exit
   ```
